My name is Asir Mosaddek Sakib. I'm a software engineer. I am very passionate about learning new technologies. I live in Dhaka, Bangladesh.
I love to eat all kind of Bengali foods, but I like the Kacchi Biriyani best. But I don't like cooking. I love to fictional books in my leisure times. My favorite writer is Rakib Hasan for Tin Goyenda series. Mostly I like detective novels by Agatha Christie, Sir Arthor Conal Doyale etc.
